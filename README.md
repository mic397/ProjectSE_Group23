# ProjectSE_Group23
Organization of work in SCRUM.

The project involves the use of the SCRUM methodology, one of the most famous AGILE
methodologies.
The first week of the work included a pre-gaming phase, during which the work was organized
by team; the User Stories were defined starting from User Epics and, a planning of the first
sprint was carried out.
The absence of the Product Owner figure, provided for the division of his role among the
members of the team itself. The work will be organized in the following way:
• 10 hours a week for the next three weeks, for the realization of the next three sprints
• the team will work on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday.
The user stories were obtained trying to respect the customer's point of view according to the
format typically required by the Scrum methodology (As a… I want… so that I can…).
A Trello board was used, at the following url:

All team members have access to it . A score was assigned to each user story, defining it in an
online meeting between team members The Planning Poker mode was used, through the
Serie of Fibonacci for the choice of the numerical value. Acceptance criteria have been defined
for each user story.
